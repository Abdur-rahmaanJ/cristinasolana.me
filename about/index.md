I'm a designer and frontend developer. I've been designing for more than half my life and coding half of that. I enjoy long hours in front of multiple computer monitors.

I'm an autodidact, who left a Criminal Justice degree behind when I purchased my first computer â€“ a 33MHz HP for $50 from @waltque. Since then I've spent unhealthy amounts of time learning about and practicing Digital Art, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web standards and performance, mobile first and responsive web development.

Currently I'm a Sr. Frontend Developer building turnkey and whitelabel digital catalogs for incentives programs at a wonderful startup with wonderful teammates in Miami.

I'm a Miami native living in Kendall with my husband, son and a terribly behaved kitten Curious.
