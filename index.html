                <strong>I've been into minimalism since before "flat" was a buzzword; it reflects my design style: bold and direct, minus the unnecessary.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Unless you live in a rural town, you're already overwhelmed by the unsolicited advertising you see on billboards, in magazines and, now even, in videos at gas station pumps and ads in your restaurant menus.</p>
            <p>I want you to come to my site, get past the fluff and decoration, find the information you're looking for - that's what's going to get you to contact me. It's the same thing I want for your visitors. If you get it, well then, <a href="mailto:cs@nightshiftcreative.com">contact me</a>.</p>
